    "(-1, 11). The robot is equipped with a sensor that can measure the range and\n",
    "relative bearing $[r, b]$ from the robot's location to each of these landmarks. If the\n",
    "robot's pose is $(x, y, \\theta)$ and the landmark position is $(l_x, l_y)$,\n",
    "then range is just the Euclidean distance $$r = \\sqrt{(l_x - x)^2 + (l_y\n",

    "and the bearing is the angle to the landmark in the robot's body frame (hence\n",
    "relative bearing), $$b = atan2(l_y - y, l_x - x) - \\theta.$$  Each of\n",
    "these measurements is corrupted with noise $[q_r, q_b]$ distributed according\n",
