    "**Notes**:\n",
    "* In this problem, you will need to constructs somewhat complicated strings.  We *strongly* encourage you to read about [Python-3 f-strings](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-f-strings-to-create-strings-in-python-3) which make this process much easier than the alternatives.\n",
    "* You may find `simulator.pretty_print_state` useful for debugging.\n",
    "* We also highly recommend printing out the domain and problem after they have been created, and copying them into [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains) to check whether it's possible to find a plan.\n",
    "* The image in catsoop with the robot and the bears is a faithful depiction of the initial state. For example, the initial locations of the people are: \"p1\": (4, 0), \"p2\": (6, 0), \"p3\": (0, 6), \"p4\": (3, 3).\n",
    "* One part of this problem that may be initially counterintuitive is the way that we'll represent locations in PDDL.\n",
    "In the simulator, a location is a tuple of integers. PDDL does not support such representations -- everything needs to be just an object with a string name.\n",
    "So to represent a location like (3, 5), we will make a string \"l3-5\" (where the first character there is a lowercase L), and we'll create an object\n",
    "with that name, of type \"location\". We will also need a way to encode the fact that the robot can only move between adjacent locations in the grid.\n",
    "In the simulator, we can compare the numeric values of locations like (3, 5) and (3, 6) to see if they are neighbors.\n",
    "But in PDDL, all we have are the objects with string names, and we need to encode everything in terms of predicates.\n",
    "So, we will create a predicate `(conn ?v0 - location ?v1 - location ?v2 - direction)`, which says that location `?v0` is connected to locaction `?v1`\n",
    "in direction `?v2`. For example, `(conn l3-5 l3-6 right)` might appear in the initial state. We can then use these `conn` predicates in\n",
    "the preconditions of a `move` operator to encode the fact that the robot can only move between adjacent locations.\n",
    "* We do not recommend modelling the hospital explicitly with special objects / types / predicates. Instead, the goal should be to deliver all people to the hospital_loc, that is, `l6-6`.\n",
    "In words, the goal should be \"person1 is at l6-6 and person2 is at l6-6 and person3 is at l6-6 and person4 is at l6-6.\"\n",
