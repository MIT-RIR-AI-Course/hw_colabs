    "### Question\n",
    "You've received PDDL domain and problem strings from your boss and you need to make a plan, pronto! Unfortunately, some of the PDDL is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here's what you know. What you're trying to model is a newspaper delivery robot. The robot starts out at a \"home base\" where there are papers that it can pick up. The robot can hold arbitrarily many papers at once. It can then move around to different locations and deliver papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Not all locations want a paper -- the goal is to satisfy all the locations that do want a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You also know:\n",
    "  * There are 6 locations in addition to 1 for the homebase. Locations 1, 2, 3, and 4 want paper; locations 5 and 6 do not.\n",
    "  * There are 8 papers at the homebase.\n",
    "  * The robot is initially at the homebase with no papers packed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use this description to complete the PDDL domain and problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you are running into issues writing or debugging the PDDL you can check out this online PDDL editor, which comes with a built-in planner: [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains). To use the editor, you can create two files, one for the domain and one for the problem. You can then click \"Solve\" at the top to use the built-in planner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general reference on PDDL, check out [planning.wiki](https://planning.wiki/). Note that the PDDL features supported by pyperplan are very limited: types and constants are supported, but that's about it. If you want to make a domain that involves more advanced features, you can try the built-in planner at [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains), or you can use any other PDDL planner of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging PDDL can be painful. The online editor at [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains) is helpful: pay attention to the syntax highlighting and to the line numbers in error messages that result from trying to Solve. To debug, you can also comment out multiple lines of your files by highlighting and using command+/. Common issues to watch out for include:\n",
    "* A predicate is not defined in the domain file\n",
    "* A variable name does not start with a question mark\n",
    "* An illegal character is used (we recommended sticking with alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores; and don't start any names with numbers)\n",
    "* An operator is missing a parameter (in general, the parameters should be exactly the variables that are used anywhere in the operator's preconditions or effects)\n",
    "* An operator is missing a necessary precondition or effect\n",
    "* Using negated preconditions, which are not allowed in basic Strips\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck debugging your PDDL file for more than 10-15 min, please reach out and we'll help!\n",
